            While I always knew I wanted a creative career, I don't feel fulfilled unless I'm helping others. I first studied Special Education and was a teacher for six years. I began writing code as a way to connect with my students, but as my interest grew, I began squeezing in time for my own projects when I wasn't writing lesson plans.
            <br><br>
            Deciding what to call myself has always been a challenge. I am passionate about design, user accessibility, and the opportunities that a strong online presence can bring a small business. I build websites, but I can also write content, give branding advice and design graphics. <br><br>

            Need a website? We may be a good match if:
            <ul id="about-list">
              <li><strong class="bold-list-text">You're on a budget.</strong> I'm self-taught and I've got cheap rates to match.</li>
              <li><strong class="bold-list-text">You'd rather work with just one person.</strong> Websites are often built by a team of people, with the developer handling the code and and a web designer handling aesthetic decisions. A team may also have a graphic designer, who handles tasks like image optimization and logo design.</li>
              <li><strong class="bold-list-text">Your website needs are simple.</strong> If you aren't sure what your needs are, I'm happy to discuss your business and website goals to determine how to best serve you!</li>
              <li><strong class="bold-list-text">You have an informal communication style. </strong>I have an artist's brain - I don't gravitate towards schedules and protocols and prefer to keep client communication casual and convenient. It is a priority for me that you feel I am accessible and easy to collaborate with.</li>
            </ul>
