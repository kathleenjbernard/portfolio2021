            <div class="cbp-l-project-desc-text">I am passionate about smart design, user accessibility, and the opportunities that a modern website can bring to a small business owner.<br><br>While I always knew I wanted a career that allowed me creative expression, I'm also an empath and find deep satisifaction in helping others. I first studied Special Education and was a teacher for six years. I began experimenting with coding as a way to connect with my students, but after diving deeper, I decided to pursue web development full time. While I originally thought of my self-taught status as a weakness, I've since realized that my background gives me unique insight.

            Need a website? We may be a good match if:
            <ul id="about-list">
              <li><strong class="bold-list-text">You'd rather hire one person instead of a team or agency.</strong> Websites are often built by a team of people, with the developer handling the code and and a web designer handling aesthetic decisions. A team may also have a graphic designer, who handles tasks like image optimization and logo design. I have skills in all of these areas.</li>
              <li><strong class="bold-list-text">You need a simple website. </strong>If you aren't sure what your needs are, I'm happy to discuss your business and website goals to determine how to best serve you!</li>
              <li><strong class="bold-list-text">You have an informal communication style. </strong>I have an artist brain - I don't gravitate towards schedules and protocols and prefer to keep client communication casual and convenient. It is a priority for me that you feel I am accessible and easy to collaborate with.</li>
            </ul>
